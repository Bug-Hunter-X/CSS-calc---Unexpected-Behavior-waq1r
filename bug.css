The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if there are issues with operator precedence. For instance, using `calc(100% - 50px)` is fine, but `calc(100% - 50%)` might lead to unexpected behavior as both values are percentages.  Another issue is nesting `calc()` expressions incorrectly, which may lead to parsing errors or unexpected outputs.  Incorrect use of whitespace around operators within `calc()` can also lead to unexpected results.  Finally, browser compatibility issues can arise with complex `calc()` expressions.
